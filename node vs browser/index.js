// Three things Node.js has that client-side JavaScript doesn't have

//1- Access to the file system: Node.js provides APIs to interact with the file system on the server-side

//2- Ability to perform server-side operations: Node.js is used to build server-side applications that can perform various operations like file processing,
// database operations, sending emails, and more. Client-side JavaScript runs on the user's browser
// and is limited to manipulating the DOM and making HTTP requests.

//3- Support for real-time applications: Node.js provides support for real-time applications using technologies like WebSockets and socket.io. 
//This feature is not available in client-side JavaScript

//Three things client-side JavaScript has that Node.js doesn't have are:

//1- Access to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM): Client-side JavaScript runs within the context of a web browser 
//and has access to the browser's DOM. This allows client-side JavaScript 
//to manipulate the content and appearance of web pages in real-time.

//2- Access to browser events: Client-side JavaScript can respond to user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements. 
//This feature allows for interactive and responsive user interfaces.

//3- Direct access to client resources: Client-side JavaScript can access the client's resources, such as local storage and cookies.
